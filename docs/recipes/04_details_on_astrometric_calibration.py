# The header of raw FITS files does not usually contain a valid WCS. The 
# astrometric calibration is implemented automatically during the 
#Â `ReducedFit.build_file()` step, and can be done separately through 
# `ReducedFit.astrometric_calibration()`.

# %% [markdown]
# For simple photometry images such as those from the Andor cameras, tries to
# detect sources in the image with different sets of parameters and 
# feeds them to a local astrometry.net solver. It tries with several sets until 
# it successfuly calibrates the image. When done through `build_file()`, if 
# calibration is not achieved, it will give the ERROR_ASTROMETRY flag, 
# otherwise it will give it the BUILT_REDUCED flag.

# For images with ordinary and extraordinary pairs such as those from CAFOS and 
# DIPOL, the reduction procedure first finds the sources and then divides them 
# in ordinaty and extraordinary lists. This is done through the utilities at
# `iop4lib.utils.sourcepairing` submodule.

# To find the pairs, the algorithm builds a distribution of the distance between
# all sources in the image, and selectes the most frequent distance with some
# resolution. This process is not free from error. It can be improved by 
# providing some bounds for this expected distance. For example, in a CAFOS 
# image such as:
