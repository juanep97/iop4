# This file defines a decision tree to choose the best methods to try to calibrate DIPOL images.

# The tree is defined as a recursive list of branches. 
# The tree is traversed from top to bottom, following only the first rule sub-branch found
# to satisfy all the conditions in the branch.
# When an attempts branch is found, all the methods in the branch are tried in order
# until one succeeds or all fail.

# The attempts branch is a list of either attempts defs or method defs, and they can define 
# also conditions to be satisfied before the attempt is tried.
